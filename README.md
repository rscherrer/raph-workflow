# raph-workflow

In this repository I share the way I like to organize my scientific projects. This may or may not be useful to anyone, but at least it is good for me to make sure I stick to my own guidelines. These guidelines were developed through lots of trial-and-error and communication with colleagues, and are the result of what I have gathered so far. They are by no means set in stone, and I hope to improve them as I go through my scientific journey. Here are my commandments to myself.

## 1. Thou shalt make use of GitHub

I opted for a "mobile" style of work: I want to have my work accessible from anywhere, any time, which means I need a "cloud" to store all my things. I host all my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com). Here are the reasons why.

### 1.1. Storage and accessibility

As I mentioned before, GitHub makes all my work accessible from anywhere. It does not allow repositories of more than 1Gb though, so it mostly hosts code for analyses or manuscripts. For big databases, I make use of Google Drive (see further section).

### 1.2. Version control

GitHub is more than Google Drive or Dropbox in that it is a version control system: I can retrieve any older version of my work easily, and all the changes I make are registered without me having to create a thousand different copies of the same files. Branches also allow multiple versions to coexist together. More later on the branch structure I follow.

### 1.3. Collaboration

Not all my repositories are collaborative, but the branch structure of repositories makes collaboration very easy. More later on the branch structure I go for when collaborating. Of course, forks allow external contributions, which is great.

### 1.4. Visibility

I can advertise my work by sharing my GitHub account! This is basically where stuff happens and where people can look up what I am up to. People can also download my work by cloning my repo, it's that easy.

### 1.5. Reproducible science

You may have heard of the [replication crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis), this idea that scientists are realizing more and more that past results are difficult, and sometimes impossible, to reproduce. Working towards making science more reproducible is therefore rising as one of the top priorities within the future generation of scientists. Reproducibility, together with open science and pre-registration, is part of a bundle of good practices to avoid biases resulting from cherry-picking, P-hacking or HARKing. I use GitHub as a tool to be part of this effort, where my work can be reviewed and myr results reproduced easily.

### 1.6. Third party add-ons

GitHub has connexions to a lot of third party platforms to do all kinds of things. I can sync my GitHub with Overleaf to work on my manuscripts in LaTeX (more on this later), but also activate Travis or Codecov on my repository to make sure my program is working.

### 1.7. When to not use GitHub

Unfortunately the storage limit within a repository is 1Gb, which makes GitHub not suitable for storing large databases used in some studies. GitHub is therefore reserved for code, analysis output and manuscripts mainly. For databases, see the relevant section.
